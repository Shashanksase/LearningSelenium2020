There 51 reserved keywords,we cannot use these keywords as class name.	

*************************************************************************************
for loops used 90% in selenium
while loops used 10% in selenium
single dimension and two dimensioanl array.

*************************************************************************************
Loops :  

When to use For Loops : Start and End Point is available.
Mostly used in read data or csv files.
	a)When we have to test login/password on a webpage
	b)read data from csv file
	c)reading the product catalog list in cart. 
************************************************************************************* 
When to use While Loops :
While loop will run till the condition appears.(ex 1 no of attempts you play till the level is achieved.)
Ex 2 Game :  No of attempt is unknown to win the Level , after win you will go to the next level.


Println : taken to the next line.
print : cursor stays there

1.Array : Storage of mulitple variable

2.Advanced For Loop or For Each : 

***********************************************************************
package loops;

public class Arrays {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		String[] str = new String[3];
		str[0] = "Shubhangi";
		str[1] = "Shubhangi Gaikwad";
		str[2] = "S Gaikwad";

		System.out.println(str[0]);

		/*
		 * for (int i=0 ; i<=2 ; i ++) { System.out.println(str[i]); }
		 */

		// Advanced For Loop

		for (String j : str) {
			System.out.println(j);
		}

	}

}
/********************************************************/

3. Different ways of initializing Array.( refer Arrays.java)
4. Type of Arrays : Single Dimension and Multi Dimension
   In Selenium we use Single Dimension Array and Two Dimensional array. 
   a)Printing the array
   b)Dynamic Array using length. 
   
   
   Question how to use enchanced for loop in 2D array.
   Ans : We cannot use  enchanced for loop for 2D array.

   static type and non-static type of function.
   
   
   1.Multiple Function with same name but different parameter is known as  Method Overloading.(Static Polymorphism)
   2. Overloading is possible  by changing the no of parameters,changing the type of parameters.
   
    
    
    31-Jan-2020
    For non-static function is called by creating an object of the class.
    For static function is called by static variables / class name
    
    variables  within the method is local variables.
    variables  within the class and  outside the method is global variables.
    
    
    Look for Static and  Non-static memory allocation.
    
    //In parallel execution always use non static variables.
    example : Launch Browser function.
    
    Properties for Static variable : url , username(if system allows same user on multiple browser,example db login) and snapshot location
    
    ************************************************************************************************
    Constructor is used to initialize the object.By default each class has a default constructor.
    Untill we create a new constructor.

    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJClDc5_H14 (getter and setter)
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah8JaZoWTxI
    
    
    "this" : will point to global variables.
    
    when we have local and instance variable with same name then we need to use "this"variable
    Two or more important constructor with different parameter == >constructor overloading.

  1. Type  of Modifier :

  1.Multiple Inheritance is not possible in class, but it is possible in interface.
  2.One class can maximum extend only one class ,reason it will have  ambiquity which to refer so java does not support mulitple class inhertieance.
  3. Overloading and Overriding :
  same name methods in child and parent it is case of overriding method.with same number of parameters.
	//same name methods in child and parent it is case of overloading method.with different number of parameters.
4.//in DynamicPolymorphism : while creating a object : obj of child class and reference of parent class
  //calling of overridden functions is resolved at run  time rather then compile time.
  
5.Data member  and method together is called as encapsulation.
 commands of mvn 
  //mvn archetype:generate
  //mvn eclipse:eclipsemvn eclipse:eclipse
  // mvn clean
  //mvn  compile
  //mvn test
 // In Maven :1.test scripts in test
              2.reusable scripts or url /xpath in main
